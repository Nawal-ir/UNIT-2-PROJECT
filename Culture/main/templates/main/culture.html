                <p style="color: aliceblue;">
                    The culture of Saudi Arabia is a rich one that has been shaped by its Islamic heritage, its historical role as an ancient trade center, and its Bedouin traditions.
                    Saudi society has experienced tremendous development over the past several decades. The Saudi people have taken their values and traditions – their customs, hospitality and even their style of dress – and adapted them to the modern world.

                <p style="color: aliceblue;">
                    Dating back 1,400 years to the first century of Islam, calligraphy is a revered art in Saudi Arabia.

                    Because its primary subject matter has historically been the Holy Qur’an, calligraphy is considered to be the quintessential Islamic art form.

                    Saudi museums collect and display rare manuscripts. Other organizations commission works of calligraphy, provide training in the art form, and hold competitions to encourage new generations of young artists.

                    Today, calligraphy is a dominant theme in metalwork, ceramics, glass textiles, painting and sculpture throughout Saudi Arabia and the Muslim world. Inscriptions often adorn the interior walls of mosques, as well as public and private offices and homes.

                <p style="color: aliceblue;">
                    A living piece of the country’s history, Saudi folk music has been shaped by the nomadic Bedouins and the pilgrims who brought musical influences from around the world.

                    The music varies from region to region – for example, in the Hijaz, the music of al-sihba combines poetry and songs of Arab Andalusia, while the folk music of Makkah and Madinah reflects these two cities’ influences from throughout the Islamic world.

                    Dance is also popular among Saudis. The national dance is the men’s sword dance known as the ardha. An ancient tradition with its roots in the country’s central area known as the Najd, the ardha is a combination of singers, dancers carrying swords and a poet or narrator. Men carrying swords stand in two lines or a circle, with a poet singing in their midst, and perform the traditional dance.

                <p style="color: aliceblue;">
                    Saudis prefer traditional clothes to Western styles of dress, and generally wear modern adaptations of age-old designs. The loose, flowing traditional garments are practical for the Kingdom’s hot, windswept climate, and in keeping with the Islamic ideal of modesty.
                <ul>
                    <li style="color: aliceblue;"><h5><strong>Men:</strong></h5>
                        <p style="color: aliceblue;">
                        Men wear an ankle-length shirt of wool or cotton known as a thawb. On their heads, they wear a large square of cotton (ghutra) that is folded diagonally over a skullcap (kufiyyah), and held in place with a cord circlet (igaal). The flowing, full-length outer cloak (bisht), generally made of wool or camel hair, completes the outfit. In the old days, the bisht was also used as a blanket while traveling.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li style="color: aliceblue;"><h5><strong>Women:</strong></h5>
                        <p style="color: aliceblue;">
                        Women customarily wear a black outer cloak (abaya) over their dress, which may well be modern in style. On their heads, Saudi women traditionally wear a shayla – a black, gauzy scarf that is wrapped around the head and secured with circlets, hats or jewelry. Traditional dress is often richly decorated with coins, sequins or brightly colored fabric appliqués.
                        Some Saudi women wear veils made of sheer material. The practice of wearing a veil is an ancient one that dates back at least two millennia, before the advent of Islam. In a harsh desert environment, a thin veil provides protection from constant exposure to the sun, which can damage the skin and eyes. Today, a veil is also a sign of modesty and virtue.

                <p style="color: aliceblue;">
                    Poetry is especially important to Arab cultural life, and has long been considered one of the highest expressions of literary art.

                    In the days when the Bedouin were constantly traveling, poetry was primarily an oral tradition. People would gather around a storyteller, who would spin tales of love, bravery, chivalry, war and historic events. This was both entertainment and an oral preservation of history, traditions and social values.
                    
                    The Holy Qur’an took the Arab love of language and poetry to new levels. It exemplifies the perfect use of the Arabic language, and is considered to be the ultimate literary model.
                    
                    Poetry remains popular among Saudis today. They gather at cultural events, most notably the Jenadriyah National Culture and Heritage Festival, and avidly read the works of established poets that are printed in Saudi Arabia every year. There is also a popular televised poetry competition.

                <p style="color: aliceblue;">
                    Many traditional dishes enjoyed in Saudi Arabia are much like the Middle Eastern cuisine found in the surrounding countries of Yemen, Egypt, Oman and the UAE. In fact, most of these countries have been “swapping” recipes and flavors for centuries, so it’s sometimes difficult to pinpoint where a dish originated. Saudi Arabia food culture follows this culinary code for the most part, but the country does lay an indisputable claim to one dish, and that’s kabsa.
                <ul>
                    <li style="color: aliceblue;"><strong>Kabsa:</strong> this dish is a delicious blend of basmati (usually) rice cooked with a variety of meats, vegetables and spices. 
                        The beauty of traditional kabsa is the way it is cooked. The name kabsa actually comes from the Arabic word kbs, meaning pressed.</li>
                    <li style="color: aliceblue;"><strong>Tamees:</strong> associated with Afghan cuisine but also a staple food for many Saudis, tamees is a flat bread traditionally baked in a tandoor, or a cylindrical clay or metal oven. Tamees is eaten with many Saudi Arabian dishes, but two popular stews served with tamees are ful (sometimes spelled fuul) and adas.</li>
                    <li style="color: aliceblue;"><strong>Umm Ali (Om Ali):</strong> known traditionally as an Egyptian dessert, umm ali is similar to bread pudding but prepared with puff pastry and no eggs.</li>
                    <li style="color: aliceblue;"><strong>Dates:</strong> Saudi Arabia is ranked fourth in the world in producing dates, and the country offers all kinds of dates to sample.</li>
